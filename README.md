# excel-vba-example

This is a spreadsheet that I use to take a list of items and turn them into a comma seperated list. I use it when somebody sends me a list of items I need to research and I need to put them into a search box somewhere or include them in a sql "in" clause.

Macro included in worksheet could serve as an example of
* VBA
* Using a button to launch a macro in a spreadsheet
* Accessing the system clipboard
